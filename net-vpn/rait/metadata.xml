	  rait, acronym for redundant array of inexpensive tunnels,
	  is the missing the missing piece of the puzzle,
	  for using wireguard to create distributed overlay networks.
	  It serves the purpose by creating point to point tunnels between all participants,
	  forming fully-meshed link-local connectivity.
	  Meanwhile, the site scope routing and underlying signaling mechanism employed to exchange node metadata,
	  is out of scope for this project.
